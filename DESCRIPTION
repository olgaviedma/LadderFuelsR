Description: Automated tool for vertical fuel continuity analysis using LiDAR data that can be applied on multiple tree species and for large-scale studies. It includes a suite of tools integrated into a standard workflow for deriving outputs meaningful to vertical fuel continuity analysis and canopy base height detection. The workflow consisted of: 1) calculating the vertical height profiles of each segmented tree; 2) identifying gaps and fuel layers; 3) estimating the distance between fuel layers; and 4) retrieving the fuel layers base height (FBH) and depth. Additionally, other functions recalculate previous metrics after considering distances > 1 m and calculate the canopy base height (CBH) as the FBH located at the largest- and at the last-distance. Moreover, the package calculates: i) the percentage of LAD comprised in each fuel layer, ii) remove fuel layers with LAD percentage < 5 %, iii) recalculate the distances among the reminder ones, and iv) identify the CBH as the FBH with the highest LAD percentage. On the other hand, when the vertical height profiles (VHP) showed only one fuel layer, it identifies a possible CBH performing a segmented linear regression (breaking points) on the cumulative sum of LAD as a function of height. Finally, a collection of plotting functions is developed to represent: i) the VHP with the initial gaps and fuel layers; ii) the FBHs, depths and gaps with distances > 1 m and, iii) the FBHs and depths after applying the breaking point method over trees with only one fuel layer.
